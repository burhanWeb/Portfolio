          Iâ€™m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and solving
          real-world problems with cloud-native technologies. I enjoy building
          systems involving background workers, media pipelines, and API-first
          design. I'm currently seeking a backend role where I can contribute to
          impactful products and grow in a collaborative team environment.
